Example - Managing Rails Logfile with Logrotate
Details
Triggers hourly
Rotate when log file is bigger than 100M
Only keep 10 copies
Configuring Ansible for Logrotate
roles/logrotate/tasks/main.yml
- name: set up logrotate for rails log
  template:
    src: rails.j2
    dest: /etc/logrotate.d/rails
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644

- name: ensure logrotate is in /etc/cron.hourly
  file:
    src: /etc/cron.daily/logrotate
    dest: /etc/cron.hourly/logrotate
    state: link
    force: yes
    mode: 0755 # the file needs to be excutable
roles/logrotate/templates/rails.j2
Modify /path/to/your/rails/log/.log to your logfileâ€™s path on your machine.

/path/to/your/rails/log/.log {
    size 100M             # triggers when file is bigger than 100M
    dateext               # use date extension
    dateformat -%Y%m%d-%s # the extention format
    rotate 10             # keep 10 files
    copytruncate          # truncates the original file
    missingok             # does not throw error if the file is missing
    notifempty            # does not rotate if the file is empty
}
Provisioning Logrotate with Ansible
Refer to Executing playbooks.

Bonus
Checking whether Logrotate can be Called by Cron
# Should print "/etc/cron.hourly/logrotate"
$ run-parts --test /etc/cron.hourly
Getting File/Directory Permission Numerical Value in Linux
I usually use sites like Chmod Calculator to map values.

$ stat --format '%a' <filename>
Finding out when cron.hourly Really Executes
$ cat /etc/cron.d/0hourly
